# Word_MailMerge
To split up Microsoft Word using VBA and mail merge, the naming is based on column named "column1"-"column2" in this format. The script needs a .docx and an. xlsx with the same name. The code will create a folder with the same name and fill it up with the splitted documents. The finished file can be edited,so it won't be refreshed every time you run the macro.
